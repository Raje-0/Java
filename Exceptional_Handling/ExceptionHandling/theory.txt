Exception handling in Java refers to the process of dealing with unexpected or exceptional events that 
occur during the execution of a program. These events, known as exceptions, can disrupt the normal flow 
of a program. Java provides a robust exception handling mechanism to handle such situations gracefully, 
preventing the abrupt termination of the program.

Here's an overview of how exception handling works in Java:

Try Block: This is where the code that might throw an exception is placed. It is followed by 
one or more catch blocks or a finally block, or both.

Catch Block: When an exception occurs within the try block, Java looks for a corresponding catch 
block that can handle the type of exception thrown. If a matching catch block is found, the exception 
is caught and handled in that block. Each catch block is responsible for handling a specific type of 
exception.

Finally Block: The finally block is optional and is used to execute important code such as closing 
resources, whether an exception is thrown or not. It is executed after the try block completes, 
regardless of whether an exception occurred.

Throw and Throws: The throw keyword is used to explicitly throw an exception. The throws keyword is 
used in method signatures to indicate that the method might throw a specific type of exception.

Types of exceptions in Java:

Checked Exceptions: These are exceptions that are checked at compile time. This means that the 
compiler forces the programmer to handle these exceptions. Examples of checked exceptions include 
IOException, SQLException, etc.

Unchecked Exceptions: Also known as runtime exceptions, these are not checked at compile time. 
Examples include NullPointerException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, and ArithmeticException. 
Programmers are not forced to handle these exceptions explicitly, but it is a good practice to 
handle them appropriately.

Error: These are serious, unrecoverable problems that should not be caught. Examples include 
OutOfMemoryError and StackOverflowError. It is generally not recommended to handle these errors.

Java's exception handling mechanism provides a structured way to manage errors and unexpected 
behavior, making it easier to write robust and reliable code. Handling exceptions properly can 
improve the overall stability and resilience of Java applications.
