In Java, instance variables are variables declared within a class but outside any method, 
constructor, or block. They belong to an instance of the class, meaning that each object 
created from the class has its own copy of these variables.

On the other hand, local variables are declared within a method, constructor, or block 
and only exist within the scope of that method, constructor, or block. They are temporary 
and are typically used for temporary storage or calculations within a specific method.

The key difference is that instance variables are associated with the instance of a class
(object), and their values persist as long as the object exists. Local variables, on the 
other hand, are short-lived and exist only during the execution of the method or block 
in which they are declared.
