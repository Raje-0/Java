Public: open to all class ----Public access is the least restrictive access level. A public class, method, 
or field can be accessed from any other class. This is often used for methods and classes 
that are intended for widespread use and interaction across different parts of the program.

Protected: Protected access allows a class to expose its member variables and methods to its 
subclasses and other classes in the same package. Protected members are not accessible outside 
the package unless they are in a subclass. This is typically used for providing controlled access 
to certain methods or fields, maintaining a balance between encapsulation and accessibility.

Default (package-private):   open to package -----If no access modifier is specified, it defaults to package-private. 
This means that the class or member is accessible within the same package but not from outside. 
It provides encapsulation within the package and is commonly used when you want to hide certain 
implementation details from classes in other packages.

Private: open to class ----Private access is the most restrictive access level. Private members are only accessible 
within the class they are declared. This is used to hide sensitive data from other classes, ensuring 
that it is only accessible and modifiable through the methods provided by the class. It is a key aspect
 of encapsulation, preventing direct access to critical data.
