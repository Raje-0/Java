1. Collection

    1.1 List
             Properties:
            - Allows duplicate elements.
            - Maintains the order in which elements are inserted.
            
            #implemented by:-
        1.1.1 ArrayList = we can not change the size of array dynamically so we use ArrayList> new size = n+n/2+1;
        1.1.2 LinkedList=
        1.1.3 Vector
        1.1.4 Stack      =LIFO,  
        
    1.2 Set
            - Properties:
            - Does not allow duplicate elements.
            - No specific order is guaranteed.
             
            #implemented by:- 
        1.2.1 HashSet       = Set property
        1.2.2 LinkedHashSet = Set property + linkedList property(order preserved)
        1.2.3 TreeSet       = Set property + in sorted form 
          
    1.3 Queue
            - Properties:
            - Represents a collection for holding elements prior to processing.
            - Typically follows the FIFO (First-In-First-Out) order. katar,
            
           #implemented by:-
        1.3.1 PriorityQueue ==Queue with priority, ex- in line there is PM, so we give him priority
        1.3.2 LinkedList
        1.3.3 ArrayDeque   

2. Map
            - Properties:
            - Stores key-value pairs.
            - Keys are unique; each key is associated with exactly one value.
