Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language originally developed by
 Sun Microsystems (acquired by Oracle Corporation in 2010). It is known for its platform independence,
 meaning that once a Java program is written, it can run on any device that has a 
 Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed, regardless of the underlying computer architecture.

Some key features of Java include:

1. **Platform independence**: Java programs are compiled into an intermediate bytecode format that can run
 on any device with a compatible JVM.

2. **Object-oriented programming (OOP)**: Java supports the creation and use of reusable and modular
 code through the use of classes and objects.

3. **Robust and secure**: Java is designed to prevent certain types of programming errors. 
It also has a strong security model that protects against viruses and other malicious software.

4. **Rich standard library**: Java comes with a vast standard library that provides support
 for a wide range of tasks, from basic input and output to networking and database access.

5. **Multithreading**: Java supports multithreading, allowing for the concurrent execution
 of multiple tasks within a single program.

Java is widely used for developing a variety of applications, including web applications,
 mobile applications, enterprise software, and embedded systems. It is also the primary language
  for developing Android applications. Additionally, it has a large and active community, which 
  contributes to its extensive ecosystem of tools, libraries, and frameworks.
  
  
  
  
Q-java is compiler or interpreter?


Java is both a compiled and interpreted programming language. Java source code is compiled 
into bytecode, which is then interpreted by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). The Java compiler 
converts the source code into an intermediate language called bytecode, which can run on any 
platform that has a compatible JVM. This characteristic of Java makes it a platform-independent 
language, as the bytecode can be executed on any system that has the appropriate JVM installed. 
This combination of compilation and interpretation allows for both efficiency and portability in 
Java applications.
