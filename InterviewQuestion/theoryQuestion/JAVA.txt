Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language originally developed by
 Sun Microsystems (acquired by Oracle Corporation in 2010). It is known for its platform independence,
 meaning that once a Java program is written, it can run on any device that has a 
 Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed, regardless of the underlying computer architecture.

Some key features of Java include:

1. **Platform independence**: Java programs are compiled into an intermediate bytecode format that can run
 on any device with a compatible JVM.

2. **Object-oriented programming (OOP)**: Java supports the creation and use of reusable and modular
 code through the use of classes and objects.

3. **Robust and secure**: Java is designed to prevent certain types of programming errors. 
It also has a strong security model that protects against viruses and other malicious software.

4. **Rich standard library**: Java comes with a vast standard library that provides support
 for a wide range of tasks, from basic input and output to networking and database access.

5. **Multithreading**: Java supports multithreading, allowing for the concurrent execution
 of multiple tasks within a single program.

Java is widely used for developing a variety of applications, including web applications,
 mobile applications, enterprise software, and embedded systems. It is also the primary language
  for developing Android applications. Additionally, it has a large and active community, which 
  contributes to its extensive ecosystem of tools, libraries, and frameworks.
  
  
  
  
Q-java is compiler or interpreter?


Java is both a compiled and interpreted programming language. Java source code is compiled 
into bytecode, which is then interpreted by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). The Java compiler 
converts the source code into an intermediate language called bytecode, which can run on any 
platform that has a compatible JVM. This characteristic of Java makes it a platform-independent 
language, as the bytecode can be executed on any system that has the appropriate JVM installed. 
This combination of compilation and interpretation allows for both efficiency and portability in 
Java applications.


Lambda Expressions:

Lambda expressions allow the introduction of functional programming concepts into Java.
They provide a concise way to express anonymous functions (function without a name).
Useful for writing more readable and expressive code, especially when working with functional interfaces.
Example:


// Before Java 8
Runnable runnable = new Runnable() {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Hello World");
    }
};

// With Lambda Expression
Runnable runnable = () -> System.out.println("Hello World");
Functional Interfaces:

A functional interface is an interface with a single abstract method (SAM).
The @FunctionalInterface annotation can be used to ensure that an interface is 
intended to be used as a functional interface.
Example:


@FunctionalInterface
interface MyFunctionalInterface {
    void myMethod();
}
Streams:

The Stream API provides a new abstraction for working with sequences of elements.
Streams allow for parallel processing of data, making it easier to write parallelizable code.
They provide a fluent API for data manipulation and transformation.
Example:


List<String> myList = Arrays.asList("a1", "a2", "b1", "c2", "c1");

myList
    .stream()
    .filter(s -> s.startsWith("c"))
    .map(String::toUpperCase)
    .sorted()
    .forEach(System.out::println);
Default Methods in Interfaces:

Java 8 allows interfaces to have method implementations with the default keyword.
This feature facilitates backward compatibility by enabling the addition of new 
methods to interfaces without breaking existing implementations.
Example:

java
Copy code
interface MyInterface {
    default void myDefaultMethod() {
        System.out.println("Default method implementation");
    }
}
Method References:

Method references provide a shorthand notation for lambda expressions when they simply call a method.
They make the code more readable by referring to methods by their names rather than providing a 
delegate to the methods.
Example:

java
Copy code
// Using lambda expression
myList.forEach(s -> System.out.println(s));

// Using method reference
myList.forEach(System.out::println);
Optional:

The Optional class is introduced to handle the absence of a value without using null references.
It encourages more explicit handling of null values, reducing the likelihood of NullPointerException.
Example:

java
Copy code
Optional<String> optional = Optional.ofNullable(getValue());
String result = optional.orElse("Default Value");
These features have played a crucial role in modernizing Java and have become integral 
parts of Java development. When discussing these features in an interview, it's important 
to understand not only their syntax but also their use cases and the problems they solve in 
software development.
