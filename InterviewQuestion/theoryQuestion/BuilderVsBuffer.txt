In Java, both StringBuffer and StringBuilder are classes that provide mutable sequences of characters. 
They are used when you need to perform a lot of modifications on strings, and you want to avoid the performance 
overhead associated with immutable strings (like those created with the String class).

Here are the key differences between StringBuffer and StringBuilder from an interview perspective:

Mutability:

StringBuffer is thread-safe and synchronized. This means that multiple threads can safely access a 
StringBuffer object concurrently without any data corruption.

StringBuilder is not thread-safe, which makes it faster than StringBuffer in a single-threaded environment. 
However, it should not be used in a multithreaded context without external synchronization.

Performance:

StringBuilder generally has better performance than StringBuffer in a single-threaded environment 
due to the absence of synchronization overhead. If thread safety is not a concern, it is usually 
recommended to use StringBuilder.

Synchronization:

StringBuffer methods are synchronized, making them thread-safe. This ensures that if one thread is 
executing a method on a StringBuffer object, other threads are blocked from executing methods on the same object.
StringBuilder methods are not synchronized. This lack of synchronization can lead to better performance 
in scenarios where thread safety is not required.


In summary, if your code is running in a single-threaded environment or you can handle synchronization 
externally, StringBuilder is generally preferred for its better performance. If thread safety is a concern 
or your code might run in a multithreaded environment, then StringBuffer should be used despite its 
potential performance overhead.
